# BMO

## Overview

bmo is a collection of packages aimed at supercharging a developers workflow.
At its core it is an application framework paired with an extensible CLI
that allows developers to quickly modularize and customize their environment for their needs.

- 0 configuration ES6 Support, no build step required for nodejs apps.

- Modularize your setup. Re-use entire collections of dependencies across similar application types easily.
- Environment aware configuration flow provided out of the box.
